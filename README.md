# blog_app
This is a basic blog application called Flaskr. Users will be able to register, log in, create posts, and edit or delete their own posts.
In this application, I have used Flask as the framework for creating python Application. Also, MySQL is used as database for storing the data of registered and logged users and all the posts related data of the application.


This application is made with the help of flask documentation : https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
